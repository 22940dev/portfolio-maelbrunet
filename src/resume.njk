        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I'm a web developer with a focus on front-end development, based in
        Brussels (Belgium). I'm highly proficient in the technologies that are at core of the modern web experience :
        HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have an interest and attention to design, accessibility and performance. I believe that very strong knowledge of these foundations is essential to being a
        good front-end developer, and everything else can be learned as needed.</p>

        <p>I feel that a good user interface is like a joke : you shouldn't have to explain it. I value simplicity and
        intuitiveness over complex and overly engineered solutions.</p>

        <p>I see open communication, empathy and inclusivity as the essential parts of a well-functioning team. For
        more information about myself, I invite you to have a look at my about page : <a href="{{ site.url }}/about">{{ site.url }}/about</a>.</p>
