Hi, I'm Maël Brunet.
<br/>
<br/>
I have a background in political sciences, but I switched to working in **web development** full-time around 2015. I’m based in Brussels, Belgium.
<br/>
<br/>
I’ve done some full-stack work, but I specialise and focus on the **front-end**. I especially enjoy working on and with **design systems** (the styleguide for this website can be found [here](/styleguide)). I currently work at Keytrade Bank. Previously, I worked at Isabel Group and Emakina on a wide range of projects and technologies. I also [speak](/projects/#presentation) at conferences, [co-organise](https://www.creativefrontend.be/) a series of developer meetups in Belgium, [mentor](https://hackyourfuture.be/) students, and occasionally [contribute](https://github.com/maeligg) to open source projects.
<br/>
<br/>
For more details about my professional experience, see my [resume](/resume) or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ma%C3%ABl-brunet-b5876118/).

This is my home on the web and portfolio for my side projects. The code for this website can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maeligg).
